# ModelPilot — Running TODO (founder)

Living checklist. Claude keeps this current as we work. Last updated: **2026-06-15 (eve)**.
(Detailed legal/terms analysis lives in `modelpilot/LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`; this is the
short, prioritized running list.)

Live URLs:
- Marketing: https://modelpilot.pages.dev/
- Console (admin + customer): https://modelpilot-console-prod.fly.dev/  (admin → `/admin`)
- Brain: https://modelpilot-brain-prod.fly.dev/  (health: `/health`)

> **▶️ RESUME HERE next session:** Core loop is proven end-to-end (gateway → brain routed 57% →
> metered to console → dashboard shows baseline-vs-actual). Remaining: confirm the leaked Anthropic
> key is rotated, deploy the account-deletion feature, and (founder track) form the entity to unlock
> live Stripe. Everything is committed/pushed.

---

## ✅ Done
- [x] Console deployed to Fly (`modelpilot-console-prod`), admin login working.
- [x] Brain deployed to Fly (`modelpilot-brain-prod`), healthy, wired to console via `CONSOLE_URL`.
- [x] Customer landing CTAs repointed to the live console (free `.fly.dev` route).
- [x] Sign out returns users to the public landing page (`LANDING_URL`, default pages.dev). **Live.**
- [x] Customers can delete their account (Settings → Danger zone; cascade-deletes all data,
      cancels Stripe sub, email-confirm required, owner-only). **Needs `fly deploy` to go live.**
- [x] Stripe billing migrated to the Meter Events API; convert-to-paid logs errors (not swallowed).
- [x] **Stripe TEST mode verified** — real Checkout + card collection + paid conversion works.
- [x] **Core end-to-end smoke test PASSED** — real Claude traffic → gateway → hosted brain routed
      57% → savings metered to the console; dashboard shows requests/routed + baseline-vs-actual.
      (Dollar value sub-cent on trivial test traffic — pipeline proven, magnitude needs real volume.)
- [x] Anthropic terms verified for the BYOK proxy; customer disclosures added (Terms §10 + docs).
- [x] Hero headline: "Cut your Claude bill through model optimization."

## 🔜 Next (in progress)
- [ ] **Deploy the account-deletion feature** — `cd ~/options-bot && git pull && fly deploy`
      (then delete the stuck "bypass-paid" test account).
- [ ] **Confirm the leaked Anthropic API key is rotated** — if the smoke test used a fresh key and
      the old one was deleted in the Anthropic console, this is done; otherwise rotate it.
- [ ] (Optional) Re-run the smoke test with realistic traffic to see a meaningful savings $ figure.
- [ ] **Stripe LIVE mode — GATED on the entity.** Set up the *live* Stripe account under the
      **company** (entity + EIN + business bank account), NOT personal/SSN — commingling weakens the
      liability veil and complicates taxes. So: form entity → EIN → business bank → activate Stripe
      live (redo the 3 keys with `sk_live_…`). Do this only after the entity exists.
- [ ] **Rotate the leaked Anthropic API key** (pasted in an earlier session — treat as compromised).

## 🏛️ Legal / corporate
- [ ] **Form the entity — S-corp.** Note: "S-corp" is a *tax election*, not an entity type — usually
      an LLC (or C-corp) that elects S-corp tax treatment. Confirm with a CPA: LLC + S-election for a
      bootstrapped solo founder, **or** Delaware C-corp if raising VC (S-corp can't take VC/foreign
      owners). Then: EIN → business bank account → keep finances separate.
- [ ] Counsel review of legal templates (Terms / Privacy / AUP / MSA / DPA); set governing law + venue.
- [ ] Trademark knockout-search "ModelPilot"; file a word mark if clear.
- [ ] Get written Anthropic confirmation of the BYOK-proxy model (enterprise comfort; optional).

## 💳 Finance / ops
- [ ] Stripe Tax / sales-tax nexus review (with CPA).
- [ ] Tech E&O + cyber-liability insurance before real production traffic.

## 🔒 Security / go-live
- [ ] Verify `CONSOLE_SECRET` is a **stable** Fly secret (don't rotate casually — it logs everyone out).
- [ ] Change any seeded/default admin password; confirm strong admin credentials.
- [ ] (Optional) Custom domain `app.modelpilot.app` via `fly certs add` — currently on free `.fly.dev`.

## 🧩 Product (optional / later)
- [ ] End-to-end smoke test: sign up (test acct) → Connect gateway → send traffic → see savings on dashboard.
- [ ] `ingest/` opt-in telemetry service (optional; deploys like the brain on port 8500).
